#Bootcamp Day Two

## words(word)
> This counts the number of occurences of any word in a string, and returns them as an object. Code can be found under 'apps/words.js'

## findMinMax(number)
> This takes a an array as it's parameter, and returns the smallest and largest elemnts in an array. If both are equal, it returns an array containing just one of them. Code can be found under 'apps/findMinMax.js'

## API
> Wrote a simple application that uses The Guardian's API to retrieve articles based on a search parameter the user entered. The user can also launch a URL of any of the articles that was returned. Code can be found under 'apps/api.js'

## Tests
> All tests are found in the tests subfolder

## Getting an API Key
> To run the API code, you'd need an API from Guardian. You can get it from [here](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/). Create a file in your root folder, and save as `.env`. Open the file, and create a variable called `API_KEY`, and assign your API key, contained within quotes to it, and save. Remember to gitignore `.env` files

## Installation
> To run, fork this to your repo, and clone to your desktop with `git clone repo_url`. Run `npm install` to install the needed packages. To run tests, use `npm test`
